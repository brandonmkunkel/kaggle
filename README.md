# Kaggle Submissions

This is a monorepo for all of my Kaggle submissions, each of which are held in separate folders.

[My kaggle account can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/brandonkunkel)

## Getting Started

This repo is currently set up to be configured with vanilla pip (instead of conda), but this may change in the future

### MacOS

1. Install HomeBrew
2. Install Python with homebrew `brew install python3.9`
3. Create virtual environment in repo root directory 
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements-macos.txt`


### Windows 

1. Install Python 3.9 (via Python homepage or `choco`, if you have choco)
2. Create virtual environment in the repo root directory
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements-windows.txt`

## Submissions

Each submission gets its own folder and the data may or may not be committed 
in source control (depending on size). Read the folders' `README.md` to get an overview of the
solution to the problem and more details on how to get started.
