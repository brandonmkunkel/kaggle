# Digit Recognizer

This competition is just a kaggle spin on the classic MNIST dataset

## Getting Start

1. Follow getting started instructions in the root directory of this repository
2. The dataset in this problem is too large to commit to source control, download the
train and test data from the [competition web page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)
and save the csv files in the `data/` folder in this folder (from repo root - `digit_recongizer/data/`)
